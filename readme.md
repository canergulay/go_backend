### Motivation

- I see a great future in Go and wanted to invest in the early stages of my path.
- I will use Gin and Gorilla Websockets in this repo, will serve as a comprehensive backend for some complicated functionality needs of a social media app.
- Will also be using PostgreSQL & Redis & Elasticsearch in conjunction.
