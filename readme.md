### Motivation

- I see a great future in Go and wanted to invest in the early stages of my path.
- I will use Gin and Gorilla Websockets in this repo, will serve as a comprehensive backend for some complicated functionality needs of a social media app.
- Will also be using PostgreSQL & Redis & Elasticsearch in conjunction.
- My opinions on Go after I spend a week with it ; I really liked it. As someone coming from Node.JS environment, it was a little bit hard to adapt it's notion (a kind of primative approach). To exemplify, I just see some loooong []byte values when I tried to print http response body and you have to convert from byte to struct, which was something bizzare to me. You have to handle a vast majority of the operations in that primative approach. However, it makes you feel confident about what you do. Take json parsing, you should create your structs beforehand and be aware of the expected response model. I really enjoyed the way GO follows, I think I will posses a long path to prooced with it.
